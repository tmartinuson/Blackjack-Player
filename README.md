## What is the problem?
Blackjack is a fun game to play as its open to all skill levels, and its rules are simple. We will implement a blackjack player to (hopefully) beat the dealer at his game. The program will answer queries relating to the current state of the game ("Dealer card is Ace, and our hand is a pair of fours", should I hit, stand, etc..).

## What is the something extra?
You know what's harder than keeping a set of rules memorized at all times? Trying to keep a running count in your head during a fast paced game of Blackjack. We plan on adding a card counting feature that keeps track of a running count of dealt cards to recommend a player's next course of action. This will follow the ruleset for keeping track of cards as they are played and will affect the recommendation given by the standard ruleset.

## What did we learn from doing this?
(This should be written after you have done the work.) What is the bottom-line? Is functional programming suitable for (part-of) the task? Make sure you include the evidence for your claims.
